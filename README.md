# InsectSurvPower
Power analysis of insect survey regime, including simulation of occurrences

This contains code for simulation of insect occurrences throughout Norway plus code for testing out different sampling regimes with regards to accuracy and power to detect time trends. It is organized as an R-package for convenience with loading and disseminating the results. Scripts can be stored a Vignettes.


**The idea is to create as separate sections:** 
*  a generic simulation routine for species presences and abundances
*  a simulation script of different scenarios with a range of statistical tests
